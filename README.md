# Machine-learning-algorithm-Practice
This repository provides Python implementations of key machine learning algorithms from scratch, emphasizing core principles and practical use for learners like MCA students building portfolios. It covers supervised, unsupervised, and ensemble methods using NumPy for transparency and experimentation. Contributions help expand its real-world applications in areas like classification and clustering.
​
# Core Features
Algorithms feature well-commented code, real-world examples, and easy extensibility without heavy libraries. Each folder includes runnable scripts demonstrating functionality, such as prediction on datasets like MNIST or breast cancer data. Setup requires only Python 3.x and NumPy, aligning with intermediate Python skills.
​
# Key Algorithms
Regression: Linear, multiple, ridge, logistic for prediction tasks.
Classification: KNN, decision trees, random forests, SVM, Naive Bayes.
Clustering: K-means, hierarchical, PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Advanced: AdaBoost, gradient boosting, Apriori for associations.
